# Introduction

This document specifies two variants of Privacy Pass issuance protocols (as defined in
{{!RFC9576}}) that allow for batched issuance
of tokens. This allows clients to request more than one token at a time and for
issuers to issue more than one token at a time.

The base Privacy Pass issuance protocol
{{!RFC9578}} defines stateless anonymous tokens,
which can either be publicly verifiable or not. While it is possible to run
multiple instances of the issuance protocol in parallel, e.g., over a
multiplexed transport such as HTTP/3 {{?HTTP3=RFC9114}} or by orchestrating
multiple HTTP requests, these ad-hoc solutions vary based on transport protocol
support. In addition, in some cases, they cannot take advantage of cryptographic
optimizations.

The first variant of the issuance protocol builds upon the privately verifiable
issuance protocol in {{RFC9578}} that uses VOPRF {{!OPRF=RFC9497}},
and allows for batched issuance of tokens. This allows clients to request more
than one token at a time and for issuers to issue more than one token at a time.
In effect, private batched issuance performance scales better than linearly.

The second variant of the issuance protocol introduces a new Client-Issuer
communication method, which allows for batched issuance of arbitrary token
types. This allows clients to request more than one token at a time and for
issuers to issue more than one token at a time. This variant has no other effect
than batching requests and responses and the issuance performance remains
linear.

This batched issuance protocol registers one new token type
({{iana-token-type}}), to be used with the PrivateToken HTTP authentication
scheme defined in {{!AUTHSCHEME=RFC9577}}.

## Terminology

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

# Motivation

Privacy Pass tokens (as defined in {{RFC9576}} and
{{!RFC9578}}) are unlinkable during issuance and
redemption. The basic issuance protocols defined in {{RFC9578}}, however, only
allow for a single token to be issued at a time for every challenge. In some
cases, especially where a large number of clients need to fetch a large number
of tokens, this may introduce performance bottlenecks.

Batched Privately Verifiable Token Issuance {{batched-private}} improves upon
the basic Privately Verifiable Token issuance protocol in the following key ways:

1. Issuing multiple tokens at once in response to a single TokenChallenge,
   thereby reducing the size of the proofs required for multiple tokens.
1. Improving server and client issuance efficiency by amortizing the cost of the
   VOPRF proof generation and verification, respectively.

Arbitrary Batched Token Issuance {{batched-arbitrary}} allows for a single
TokenRequest to be sent that encompasses multiple token requests. This
enables the issuance of tokens for more than one key in one round trip
between the Client and the Issuer. The cost of token generation remains linear.

# Presentation Language

This document uses the TLS presentation language {{!RFC8446}} to describe the
structure of protocol messages.  In addition to the base syntax, it uses two
additional features: the ability for fields to be optional and the ability for
vectors to have variable-size length headers.

## Optional Value

An optional value is encoded with a presence-signaling octet, followed by the
value itself if present.  When decoding, a presence octet with a value other
than 0 or 1 MUST be rejected as malformed.

~~~ tls-presentation
struct {
    uint8 present;
    select (present) {
        case 0: struct{};
        case 1: T value;
    };
} optional<T>;
~~~

## Variable-Size Vector Length Headers

In the TLS presentation language, vectors are encoded as a sequence of encoded
elements prefixed with a length.  The length field has a fixed size set by
specifying the minimum and maximum lengths of the encoded sequence of elements.

In this document, there are several vectors whose sizes vary over significant
ranges.  So instead of using a fixed-size length field, it uses a variable-size
length using a variable-length integer encoding based on the one described in
{{Section 16 of ?RFC9000}}. They differ only in that the one here requires a
minimum-size encoding. Instead of presenting min and max values, the vector
description simply includes a `V`. For example:

~~~ tls-presentation
struct {
    uint32 fixed<0..255>;
    opaque variable<V>;
} StructWithVectors;
~~~

# Batched Privately Verifiable Token Issuance {#batched-private}

This section describes a batched issuance protocol for select token types,
including 0x0001 (defined in {{RFC9578}}) and 0x0005 (defined in this document).
This variant is more efficient than Arbitary Batch Token Issuance defined below.
It does so by requiring the same key to be used by all token requests.

## Client-to-Issuer Request {#client-to-issuer-request}

Except where specified otherwise, the client follows the same protocol as
described in {{RFC9578, Section 5.1}}.

The Client first creates a context as follows:

~~~
client_context = SetupVOPRFClient(ciphersuiteID, pkI)
~~~

`ciphersuiteID` is the ciphersuite identifier from {{OPRF}} corresponding to the
ciphersuite being used for this token version. SetupVOPRFClient is defined in
{{OPRF, Section 3.2}}.

`Nr` denotes the number of tokens the clients wants to request. For every token,
the Client then creates an issuance request message for a random value `nonce`
with the input challenge and Issuer key identifier as described below:

~~~
nonce_i = random(32)
challenge_digest = SHA256(challenge)
token_input = concat(token_type, nonce_i, challenge_digest,
                token_key_id)
blind_i, blinded_element_i = client_context.Blind(token_input)
~~~

`token_type` corresponds to the 2-octet integer in the challenge.

The above is repeated for each token to be requested. Importantly, a fresh nonce
MUST be sampled each time.

The Client then creates a BatchTokenRequest structured as follows:

~~~tls
struct {
    uint8_t blinded_element[Ne];
} BlindedElement;

struct {
   uint16_t token_type;
   uint8_t truncated_token_key_id;
   BlindedElement blinded_elements<V>;
} BatchTokenRequest;
~~~

The structure fields are defined as follows:

- "token_type" is a 2-octet integer, which matches the type in the challenge.

- "truncated_token_key_id" is the least significant byte of the `token_key_id`
  in network byte order (in other words, the last 8 bits of `token_key_id`).

- "blinded_elements" is a list of `Nr` serialized elements, each of length `Ne`
  bytes and computed as `SerializeElement(blinded_element_i)`, where
  blinded_element_i is the i-th output sequence of `Blind` invocations above. Ne
  is as defined in {{OPRF, Section 4}}.

The Client then generates an HTTP POST request to send to the Issuer Request
URL, with the BatchTokenRequest as the content. The media type for this request
is "application/private-token-privately-verifiable-batch-request". An example
request for the Issuer Request URL "https://issuer.example.net/request" is shown
below.

~~~
POST /request HTTP/1.1
Host: issuer.example.net
Accept: application/private-token-privately-verifiable-batch-response
Content-Type: application/private-token-privately-verifiable-batch-request
Content-Length: <Length of BatchTokenRequest>

<Bytes containing the BatchTokenRequest>
~~~

## Issuer-to-Client Response {#issuer-to-client-response}

Except where specified otherwise, the client follows the same protocol as
described in {{RFC9578, Section 5.2}}.

Upon receipt of the request, the Issuer validates the following conditions:

- The BatchTokenRequest contains a supported token_type equal to one of the
  batched token types defined in this document.
- The BatchTokenRequest.truncated_token_key_id corresponds to a key ID of a
  Public Key owned by the issuer.
- Nr, as determined based on the size of BatchTokenRequest.blinded_elements, is
  less than or equal to the number of tokens that the issuer can issue in a
  single batch.

If any of these conditions is not met, the Issuer MUST return an HTTP 422
(Unprocessable Content) error to the client.

The Issuer then tries to deseralize the i-th element of
BatchTokenRequest.blinded_elements using DeserializeElement from {{Section 2.1
of OPRF}}, yielding `blinded_element_i` of type `Element`. If this fails for any
of the BatchTokenRequest.blinded_elements values, the Issuer MUST return an HTTP
422 (Unprocessable Content) error to the client. Otherwise, if the Issuer is
willing to produce a token to the Client, the issuer forms a list of `Element`
values, denoted `blinded_elements`, and computes a blinded response as follows:

~~~
server_context = SetupVOPRFServer(ciphersuiteID, skI, pkI)
evaluated_elements, proof =
  server_context.BlindEvaluateBatch(skI, blinded_elements)
~~~

`ciphersuiteID` is the ciphersuite identifier from {{OPRF}} corresponding to the
ciphersuite being used for this token version. SetupVOPRFServer is defined in
{{OPRF, Section 3.2}}. The issuer uses a list of blinded elements to compute in
the proof generation step. The `BlindEvaluateBatch` function is a batch-oriented
version of the `BlindEvaluate` function described in {{OPRF, Section 3.3.2}}.
The description of `BlindEvaluateBatch` is below.

~~~
Input:

  Element blindedElements[Nr]

Output:

  Element evaluatedElements[Nr]
  Proof proof

Parameters:

  Group G
  Scalar skS
  Element pkS

def BlindEvaluateBatch(blindedElements):
  evaluatedElements = []
  for blindedElement in blindedElements:
    evaluatedElements.append(skS * blindedElement)

  proof = GenerateProof(skS, G.Generator(), pkS,
                        blindedElements, evaluatedElements)
  return evaluatedElements, proof
~~~

The Issuer then creates a BatchTokenResponse structured as follows:

~~~tls
struct {
    uint8_t evaluated_element[Ne];
} EvaluatedElement;

struct {
   EvaluatedElement evaluated_elements<V>;
   uint8_t evaluated_proof[Ns + Ns];
} BatchTokenResponse;
~~~

The structure fields are defined as follows:

- "evaluated_elements" is a list of `Nr` serialized elements, each of length
  `Ne` bytes and computed as `SerializeElement(evaluate_element_i)`, where
  evaluate_element_i is the i-th output of `BlindEvaluate`.

- "evaluated_proof" is the (Ns+Ns)-octet serialized proof, which is a pair of
  Scalar values, computed as `concat(SerializeScalar(proof[0]),
  SerializeScalar(proof[1]))`, where Ns is as defined in {{OPRF, Section 4}}.

The Issuer generates an HTTP response with status code 200 whose content
consists of TokenResponse, with the content type set as
"application/private-token-privately-verifiable-batch-response".

~~~
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/private-token-privately-verifiable-batch-response
Content-Length: <Length of BatchTokenResponse>

<Bytes containing the BatchTokenResponse>
~~~

## Finalization {#finalization}

Upon receipt, the Client handles the response and, if successful, deserializes
the body values TokenResponse.evaluate_response and
TokenResponse.evaluate_proof, yielding `evaluated_elements` and `proof`. If
deserialization of either value fails, the Client aborts the protocol.
Otherwise, the Client processes the response as follows:

~~~
authenticator_values = client_context.FinalizeBatch(token_input, blind,
                         evaluated_elements, blinded_elements, proof)
~~~

The `FinalizeBatch` function is a batched variant of the `Finalize` function as
defined in {{OPRF, Section 3.3.2}}. `FinalizeBatch` accepts lists of evaluated
elements and blinded elements as input parameters, and is implemented as
described below:

~~~
Input:

  PrivateInput input
  Scalar blind
  Element evaluatedElements[Nr]
  Element blindedElements[Nr]
  Proof proof

Output:

  opaque output[Nh * Nr]

Parameters:

  Group G
  Element pkS

Errors: VerifyError

def FinalizeBatch(input, blind,
  evaluatedElements, blindedElements, proof):
  if VerifyProof(G.Generator(), pkS, blindedElements,
                 evaluatedElements, proof) == false:
    raise VerifyError

  output = nil
  for evaluatedElement in evaluatedElements:
    N = G.ScalarInverse(blind) * evaluatedElement
    unblindedElement = G.SerializeElement(N)
    hashInput = I2OSP(len(input), 2) || input ||
                I2OSP(len(unblindedElement), 2) || unblindedElement ||
                "Finalize"
    output = concat(output, Hash(hashInput))

  return output
~~~

If this succeeds, the Client then constructs `Nr` Token values, where
`authenticator` is the i-th Nh-byte length slice of `authenticator_values` that
corresponds to `nonce`, the i-th nonce that was sampled in
{{client-to-issuer-request}}:

~~~
struct {
    uint16_t token_type;
    uint8_t nonce[32];
    uint8_t challenge_digest[32];
    uint8_t token_key_id[32];
    uint8_t authenticator[Nh];
} Token;
~~~

If the FinalizeBatch function fails, the Client aborts the protocol. Token
verification works exactly as specified in {{RFC9578}}.

# Arbitrary Batched Token Issuance {#batched-arbitrary}

This section describes an issuance protocol mechanism for issuing multiple
tokens in one round trip between Client and Issuer. An arbitrary batched token
request can contain token requests for any token type.

## Client-to-Issuer Request {#arbitrary-client-to-issuer-request}

The Client first generates all of the individual TokenRequest structures that
are intended to be batched together. This request creation follows the protocol
describing issuance, such as {{RFC9578, Section 5.1}} or {{RFC9578, Section 6.1}}.

The Client then creates a BatchedTokenRequest structure as follows:

~~~tls
struct {
   uint16_t token_type;
   select (token_type) {
      case (0x0001): /* Type VOPRF(P-384, SHA-384), RFC 9578 */
         uint8_t truncated_token_key_id;
         uint8_t blinded_msg[Ne];
      case (0x0002): /* Type Blind RSA (2048-bit), RFC 9578 */
         uint8_t truncated_token_key_id;
         uint8_t blinded_msg[Nk];
   }
} TokenRequest;

struct {
  TokenRequest token_requests<V>;
} BatchTokenRequest
~~~

The structure fields are defined as follows:

- TokenRequest's "token_type" is a 2-octet integer. TokenRequest MUST always start
  with a uint16 "token_type" indicating the token type. The rest of the
  structure follows based on that type, within the inner opaque token_request
  attribute. The above definition corresponds to TokenRequest from {{RFC9578}}.
  A TokenRequest with a token type not defined in {{RFC9578}} MAY be used but
  MUST always start with a 2-octet token_type.

- "token_requests" is an array of TokenRequest satisfying the above constraint.


The Client then generates an HTTP POST request to send to the Issuer Request
URL, with the BatchTokenRequest as the content. The media type for this request
is "application/private-token-arbitrary-batch-request". An example request for
the Issuer Request URL "https://issuer.example.net/request" is shown below.

~~~
POST /request HTTP/1.1
Host: issuer.example.net
Accept: application/private-token-arbitrary-batch-response
Content-Type: application/private-token-arbitrary-batch-request
Content-Length: <Length of BatchTokenRequest>

<Bytes containing the BatchTokenRequest>
~~~

## Issuer-to-Client Response {#arbitrary-issuer-to-client-response}

Upon receipt of the request, the Issuer validates the following conditions:

- The Content-Type is application/private-token-arbitrary-batch-request as
  registered with IANA.

If this condition is not met, the Issuer MUST return an HTTP 422 (Unprocessable
Content) error to the client.

The Issuer then tries to deserialize the first 2 bytes of the i-th element of
BatchTokenRequest.token_requests. If this is not a token type registered with
IANA, the Issuer MUST return an HTTP 422 (Unprocessable Content) error to the
client. The issuer creates a BatchTokenResponse structured as follows:

~~~tls
struct {
  select (token_type) {
    case (0x0001): /* Type VOPRF(P-384, SHA-384), RFC 9578 */
      uint8_t evaluated_msg[Ne];
      uint8_t evaluated_proof[Ns + Ns];
    case (0x0002): /* Type Blind RSA (2048-bit), RFC 9578 */
      uint8_t blind_sig[Nk];
  }
} TokenResponse;

struct {
  optional<TokenResponse> token_response; /* Defined by token_type */
} OptionalTokenResponse;

struct {
  OptionalTokenResponse token_responses<V>;
} BatchTokenResponse
~~~

BatchTokenResponse.token_responses is a vector of OptionalTokenResponses, length
prefixed with two bytes. OptionalTokenResponse.token_response is a
length-prefix-encoded TokenResponse, where a length of 0 indicates that the
Issuer failed or refused to issue the associated TokenRequest.

The Issuer generates an HTTP response with status code 200 whose content
consists of TokenResponse, with the content type set as
"application/private-token-arbitrary-batch-response".

If the Issuer issues some tokens but not all, it MUST return an HTTP 206 to the
client and continue processing further requests.

~~~
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/private-token-arbitrary-batch-response
Content-Length: <Length of BatchTokenResponse>

<Bytes containing the BatchTokenResponse>
~~~



## Finalization {#arbitrary-finalization}

The Client tries to deserialize the i-th element of
BatchTokenResponse.token_responses using the protocol associated to
BatchTokenRequest.token_type. If the element has a size of 0, the Client MUST
ignore this token, and continue processing the next token. The Client finalizes
each deserialized TokenResponse using the matching TokenRequest according to the
corresponding finalization procedure defined by the token type.

# Security considerations {#security-considerations}

## Batched Privately Verifiable Tokens

Implementors SHOULD be aware of the security considerations described in {{OPRF,
Section 6.2.3}} and implement mitigation mechanisms. Application can mitigate
this issue by limiting the number of clients and limiting the number of token
requests per client per key.

## Arbitrary Batched Verifiable Tokens

Implementors SHOULD be aware of the inherent linear cost of this token type. An
Issuer MAY ignore TokenRequest if the number of tokens per request past a limit.

# IANA considerations

This section contains IANA codepoint allocation requests.

## Token Type {#iana-token-type}

This document updates the "Token Type" Registry ({{AUTHSCHEME}}) with the
following entry:

* Value: 0x0005 (suggested)
* Name: VOPRF (ristretto255, SHA-512)
* Token Structure: As defined in {{Section 2.2 of AUTHSCHEME}}
* Token Key Encoding: Serialized using SerializeElement from {{Section 2.1 of
  OPRF}}
* TokenChallenge Structure: As defined in {{Section 2.1 of AUTHSCHEME}}
* Publicly Verifiable: N
* Public Metadata: N
* Private Metadata: N
* Nk: 32
* Nid: 32
* Change controller: IETF
* Reference: {{RFC9578, Section 5}}
* Notes: None

## Media Types

The following entries should be added to the IANA "media types" registry:

- "application/private-token-privately-verifiable-batch-request"
- "application/private-token-privately-verifiable-batch-response"
- "application/private-token-arbitrary-batch-request"
- "application/private-token-arbitrary-batch-response"

## Issuance Protocol Arbitrary Batched {#test-vectors-arbitrary-batched}

The test vector below lists the following values:

- issuance: An array of parameters required to generate TokenRequest batched
  in the current test vector. This is sharded by a parameter type which is
  the protocol token type, represented as a hexadecimal string.
  Depending on the type, issuance contains different information

  type 0x0001
  - skS: The Issuer Private Key, serialized using SerializeScalar from
    {{Section 2.1 of OPRF}} and represented as a hexadecimal string.
  - pkS: The Issuer Public Key, serialized according to the encoding in {{RFC9578, Section 8.2.1}}.
  - token_challenge: A randomly generated TokenChallenge structure, represented
    as a hexadecimal string.
  - nonce: The 32-byte client nonce generated according to {{RFC9578, Section 5}},
    represented as a hexadecimal string.
  - blind: The blind used when computing the OPRF blinded message, serialized
    using SerializeScalar from {{Section 2.1 of OPRF}} and represented as a
    hexadecimal string.
  - token: The output Token from the protocol, represented as a hexadecimal
    string.

  type 0x0002
  - skS: The PEM-encoded PKCS#8 RSA Issuer Private Key used for signing tokens,
    represented as a hexadecimal string.
  - pkS: The Issuer Public Key, serialized according to the encoding in {{RFC9578, Section 8.2.2}}.
  - token_challenge: A randomly generated TokenChallenge structure, represented
    as a hexadecimal string.
  - nonce: The 32-byte client nonce generated according to {{RFC9578, Section 6}},
    represented as a hexadecimal string.
  - blind: The blind used when computing the blind RSA blinded message,
    represented as a hexadecimal string.
  - salt: The randomly generated 48-byte salt used when encoding the blinded
    token request message, represented as a hexadecimal string.
  - token: The output Token from the protocol, represented as a hexadecimal
    string.

- token_request: The BatchedTokenRequest message constructed according to
  {{arbitrary-client-to-issuer-request}}, represented as a hexadecimal string.
- token_response: The BatchedTokenResponse message constructed according to
  {{arbitrary-issuer-to-client-response}}, represented as a hexadecimal string.


Note to implementers:
Arbitrary batched token is an issuance protocol that does not define
a token type. You should decide which test vectors is required for
your implementation. The batch for each test vector is the following

- Test vector 1: [0x0001]
- Test vector 2: [0x0002]
- Test vector 3: [0x0001, 0x0001]
- Test vector 4: [0x0002, 0x0002]
- Test vector 5: [0x0001, 0x0002]
