# Introduction

This document specifies two variants of Privacy Pass issuance protocols (as
defined in {{!RFC9576}}) that allow for batched issuance of tokens. This allows
clients to request more than one token at a time and for issuers to issue more
than one token at a time.

The base Privacy Pass issuance protocol {{!RFC9578}} defines stateless anonymous
tokens, which can either be publicly verifiable or not. While it is possible to
run multiple instances of the issuance protocol in parallel, e.g., over a
multiplexed transport such as HTTP/3 {{?HTTP3=RFC9114}} or by orchestrating
multiple HTTP requests, these ad-hoc solutions vary based on transport protocol
support. In addition, in some cases, they cannot take advantage of cryptographic
optimizations.

The first variant of the issuance protocol builds upon the privately verifiable
issuance protocol in {{RFC9578}} that uses VOPRF {{!OPRF=RFC9497}}, and allows
for batched issuance of tokens and amortizes the cost of zero knowledge proofs.
This allows clients to request more than one token at a time and for issuers to
issue more than one token at a time. In effect, private batched issuance
performance scales better than linearly.

The second variant of the issuance protocol introduces a new Client-Issuer
communication method, which allows for batched issuance of generic token
types. This allows clients to request more than one token at a time and for
issuers to issue more than one token at a time. This variant has no other effect
than batching requests and responses and the issuance performance remains
linear.

This document registers a new token type ({{iana-token-type}}) that can either
be used with the Privately Verifiable Issuance Protocol as defined in
{{RFC9578}}, or with the Amortized Privately Verifiable Batch Issuance Protocol
defined below.

## Terminology

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

# Motivation

Privacy Pass tokens (as defined in {{RFC9576}} and {{!RFC9578}}) are unlinkable
during issuance and redemption. The basic issuance protocols defined in
{{RFC9578}}, however, only allow for a single token to be issued at a time for
every challenge. In some cases, especially where a large number of clients need
to fetch a large number of tokens, this may introduce performance bottlenecks.

Amortized Privately Verifiable Token Issuance {{amortized-batch}} improves upon
the basic Privately Verifiable Token issuance protocol in the following key ways:

1. Issuing multiple tokens at once in response to a single TokenChallenge,
   thereby reducing the size of the proofs required for multiple tokens.
2. Improving server and client issuance efficiency by amortizing the cost of the
   VOPRF proof generation and verification, respectively.

Generic Token Batch Issuance {{generic-batch}} allows for a single
GenericBatchTokenRequest to be sent that encompasses multiple token requests.
This improves upon the basic issuance protocols defined in {{RFC9578}} in the following key ways:

1. Issuing multiple tokens at once of the same type with different keys.
2. Issuing multiple tokens at once of different types.

# Presentation Language

This document uses the TLS presentation language {{!RFC8446}} to describe the
structure of protocol messages.  In addition to the base syntax, it uses two
additional features: the ability for fields to be optional and the ability for
vectors to have variable-size length headers.

## Optional Value {#optional-value}

An optional value is encoded with a presence-signaling octet, followed by the
value itself if present.  When decoding, a presence octet with a value other
than 0 or 1 MUST be rejected as malformed.

~~~ tls-presentation
struct {
    uint8 present;
    select (present) {
        case 0: struct{};
        case 1: T value;
    };
} optional<T>;
~~~

## Variable-Size Vector Length Headers

In the TLS presentation language, vectors are encoded as a sequence of encoded
elements prefixed with a length.  The length field has a fixed size set by
specifying the minimum and maximum lengths of the encoded sequence of elements.

In this document, there are several vectors whose sizes vary over significant
ranges.  So instead of using a fixed-size length field, it uses a variable-size
length using a variable-length integer encoding based on the one described in
{{Section 16 of ?RFC9000}}. They differ only in that the one here requires a
minimum-size encoding. Instead of presenting min and max values, the vector
description simply includes a `V`. For example:

~~~ tls-presentation
struct {
    uint32 fixed<0..255>;
    opaque variable<V>;
} StructWithVectors;
~~~

# Amortized Privately Verifiable Token Batch Issuance {#amortized-batch}

This section describes a batched issuance protocol for select token types,
including 0x0001 (defined in {{RFC9578}}) and 0x0005 (defined in this document).
This variant is more efficient than Generic Token Batch Issuance defined below.
It does so by requiring the same key to be used by all token requests.

## Client-to-Issuer Request {#client-to-issuer-request}

Except where specified otherwise, the client follows the same protocol as
described in {{RFC9578, Section 5.1}}.

The Client first creates a context as follows:

~~~
client_context = SetupVOPRFClient(ciphersuiteID, pkI)
~~~

`ciphersuiteID` is the ciphersuite identifier from {{OPRF}} corresponding to the
ciphersuite being used for this token version. SetupVOPRFClient is defined in
{{OPRF, Section 3.2}}.

`Nr` denotes the number of tokens the clients wants to request. For every token,
the Client then creates an issuance request message for a random value `nonce`
with the input challenge and Issuer key identifier as described below:

~~~
nonce_i = random(32)
challenge_digest = SHA256(challenge)
token_input = concat(token_type, nonce_i, challenge_digest,
                token_key_id)
blind_i, blinded_element_i = client_context.Blind(token_input)
~~~

`token_type` corresponds to the 2-octet integer in the challenge.

The above is repeated for each token to be requested. Importantly, a fresh nonce
MUST be sampled each time.

The Client then creates a BatchTokenRequest structured as follows:

~~~tls
struct {
    uint8_t blinded_element[Ne];
} BlindedElement;

struct {
   uint16_t token_type;
   uint8_t truncated_token_key_id;
   BlindedElement blinded_elements<V>;
} AmortizedBatchTokenRequest;
~~~

The structure fields are defined as follows:

- "token_type" is a 2-octet integer, which matches the type in the challenge.

- "truncated_token_key_id" is the least significant byte of the `token_key_id`
  in network byte order (in other words, the last 8 bits of `token_key_id`).

- "blinded_elements" is a list of `Nr` serialized elements, each of length `Ne`
  bytes and computed as `SerializeElement(blinded_element_i)`, where
  blinded_element_i is the i-th output sequence of `Blind` invocations above. Ne
  is as defined in {{OPRF, Section 4}}.

The Client then generates an HTTP POST request to send to the Issuer Request
URL, with the AmortizedBatchTokenRequest as the content. The media type for this
request MUST be "application/private-token-amortized-batch-request". If not, the
Issuer responds with status code 415. An example request for the Issuer Request
URL "https://issuer.example.net/request" is shown below.

~~~
POST /request HTTP/1.1
Host: issuer.example.net
Accept: application/private-token-amortized-batch-response
Content-Type: application/private-token-amortized-batch-request
Content-Length: <Length of AmortizedBatchTokenRequest>

<Bytes containing the AmortizedBatchTokenRequest>
~~~

## Issuer-to-Client Response {#issuer-to-client-response}

Except where specified otherwise, the client follows the same protocol as
described in {{RFC9578, Section 5.2}}.

Upon receipt of the request, the Issuer validates the following conditions:

- The AmortizedBatchTokenRequest contains a supported token_type of the
  privatley verifiable token kind.
- The AmortizedBatchTokenRequest.truncated_token_key_id corresponds to a key ID
  of a Public Key owned by the issuer.
- Nr, as determined based on the size of
  AmortizedBatchTokenRequest.blinded_elements, is less than or equal to the
  number of tokens that the issuer can issue in a single batch.

If any of these conditions is not met, the Issuer MUST return an HTTP 422
(Unprocessable Content) error to the client.

The Issuer then tries to deseralize the i-th element of
AmortizedBatchTokenRequest.blinded_elements using DeserializeElement from
{{Section 2.1 of OPRF}}, yielding `blinded_element_i` of type `Element`. If this
fails for any of the AmortizedBatchTokenRequest.blinded_elements values, the
Issuer MUST return an HTTP 422 (Unprocessable Content) error to the client.
Otherwise, if the Issuer is willing to produce a token to the Client, the issuer
forms a list of `Element` values, denoted `blinded_elements`, and computes a
blinded response as follows:

~~~
server_context = SetupVOPRFServer(ciphersuiteID, skI, pkI)
evaluated_elements, proof =
  server_context.BlindEvaluateBatch(skI, blinded_elements)
~~~

`ciphersuiteID` is the ciphersuite identifier from {{OPRF}} corresponding to the
ciphersuite being used for this token version. SetupVOPRFServer is defined in
{{OPRF, Section 3.2}}. The issuer uses a list of blinded elements to compute in
the proof generation step. The `BlindEvaluateBatch` function is a batch-oriented
version of the `BlindEvaluate` function described in {{OPRF, Section 3.3.2}}.
The description of `BlindEvaluateBatch` is below.

~~~
Input:

  Element blindedElements[Nr]

Output:

  Element evaluatedElements[Nr]
  Proof proof

Parameters:

  Group G
  Scalar skS
  Element pkS

def BlindEvaluateBatch(blindedElements):
  evaluatedElements = []
  for blindedElement in blindedElements:
    evaluatedElements.append(skS * blindedElement)

  proof = GenerateProof(skS, G.Generator(), pkS,
                        blindedElements, evaluatedElements)
  return evaluatedElements, proof
~~~

The Issuer then creates a AmortizedBatchTokenResponse structured as follows:

~~~tls
struct {
    uint8_t evaluated_element[Ne];
} EvaluatedElement;

struct {
   EvaluatedElement evaluated_elements<V>;
   uint8_t evaluated_proof[Ns + Ns];
} AmortizedBatchTokenResponse;
~~~

The structure fields are defined as follows:

- "evaluated_elements" is a list of `Nr` serialized elements, each of length
  `Ne` bytes and computed as `SerializeElement(evaluate_element_i)`, where
  evaluate_element_i is the i-th output of `BlindEvaluate`.

- "evaluated_proof" is the (Ns+Ns)-octet serialized proof, which is a pair of
  Scalar values, computed as `concat(SerializeScalar(proof[0]),
  SerializeScalar(proof[1]))`, where Ns is as defined in {{OPRF, Section 4}}.

The Issuer MUST generate an HTTP response with status code 200 whose content
consists of AmortizedBatchTokenResponse, with the content type set as
"application/private-token-amorrized-batch-response". Clients MUST ignore the
response if the status code is not 200 or if the content type is not
"application/private-token-amortized-batch-response".

~~~
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/private-token-amortized-batch-response
Content-Length: <Length of AmortizedBatchTokenResponse>

<Bytes containing the AmortizedBatchTokenResponse>
~~~

## Finalization {#finalization}

Upon receipt, the Client handles the response and, if successful, deserializes
the body values AmortizedBatchTokenResponse.evaluate_response and
AmortizedBatchTokenResponse.evaluate_proof, yielding `evaluated_elements` and
`proof`. If deserialization of either value fails, the Client aborts the
protocol. Otherwise, the Client processes the response as follows:

~~~
authenticator_values = client_context.FinalizeBatch(token_input, blind,
                         evaluated_elements, blinded_elements, proof)
~~~

The `FinalizeBatch` function is a batched variant of the `Finalize` function as
defined in {{OPRF, Section 3.3.2}}. `FinalizeBatch` accepts lists of evaluated
elements and blinded elements as input parameters, and is implemented as
described below:

~~~
Input:

  PrivateInput input
  Scalar blind
  Element evaluatedElements[Nr]
  Element blindedElements[Nr]
  Proof proof

Output:

  opaque output[Nh * Nr]

Parameters:

  Group G
  Element pkS

Errors: VerifyError

def FinalizeBatch(input, blind,
  evaluatedElements, blindedElements, proof):
  if VerifyProof(G.Generator(), pkS, blindedElements,
                 evaluatedElements, proof) == false:
    raise VerifyError

  output = nil
  for evaluatedElement in evaluatedElements:
    N = G.ScalarInverse(blind) * evaluatedElement
    unblindedElement = G.SerializeElement(N)
    hashInput = I2OSP(len(input), 2) || input ||
                I2OSP(len(unblindedElement), 2) || unblindedElement ||
                "Finalize"
    output = concat(output, Hash(hashInput))

  return output
~~~

If this succeeds, the Client then constructs `Nr` Token values, where
`authenticator` is the i-th Nh-byte length slice of `authenticator_values` that
corresponds to `nonce`, the i-th nonce that was sampled in
{{client-to-issuer-request}}:

~~~
struct {
    uint16_t token_type;
    uint8_t nonce[32];
    uint8_t challenge_digest[32];
    uint8_t token_key_id[32];
    uint8_t authenticator[Nh];
} Token;
~~~

If the FinalizeBatch function fails, the Client aborts the protocol. Token
verification works exactly as specified in {{RFC9578}}.

# Generic Token Batch Issuance {#generic-batch}

This section describes an issuance protocol mechanism for issuing multiple
tokens in one round trip between Client and Issuer. An generic batch token
request can contain token requests for any token type.

## Client-to-Issuer Request {#generic-client-to-issuer-request}

The Client first generates all of the individual TokenRequest structures that
are intended to be batched together. This request creation follows the protocol
describing issuance, such as {{RFC9578, Section 5.1}} or {{RFC9578, Section 6.1}}.

The Client then creates a GenericBatchedTokenRequest structure as follows:

~~~tls
struct {
   uint16_t token_type;
   select (token_type) {
      case (0x0001): /* Type VOPRF(P-384, SHA-384), RFC 9578 */
         TokenRequest token_request;
      case (0x0002): /* Type Blind RSA (2048-bit), RFC 9578 */
          TokenRequest token_request;
      case (0x0005): /* Type VOPRF(ristretto255, SHA-512), RFC 9578 */
          TokenRequest token_request;
   }
} GenericTokenRequest;

struct {
  GenericTokenRequest generic_token_requests<V>;
} GenericBatchTokenRequest
~~~

The structure fields are defined as follows:

- GenericBatchTokenRequest's "token_type" is a 2-octet integer. The rest of the
  structure follows with the TokenRequest based on that type. A TokenRequest
  with a token type not defined in {{RFC9578}} MAY.

- "token_requests" is an array of GenericTokenRequest satisfying the above
  constraint.

The Client then generates an HTTP POST request to send to the Issuer Request
URL, with the GenericBatchTokenRequest as the content. The media type for this
request MUST be "application/private-token-generic-batch-request". If not, the
Issuer responds with status code 415. An example request for the Issuer Request
URL "https://issuer.example.net/request" is shown below.

~~~
POST /request HTTP/1.1
Host: issuer.example.net
Accept: application/private-token-generic-batch-response
Content-Type: application/private-token-generic-batch-request
Content-Length: <Length of GenericBatchTokenRequest>

<Bytes containing the GenericBatchTokenRequest>
~~~

## Issuer-to-Client Response {#generic-issuer-to-client-response}

Upon receipt of the request, the Issuer validates the following conditions:

- The Content-Type is application/private-token-generic-batch-request as
  registered with IANA.

If this condition is not met, the Issuer MUST return an HTTP 422 (Unprocessable
Content) error to the client.

The Issuer then tries to deserialize the first 2 bytes of the i-th element of
GenericBatchTokenRequest.token_requests. If this is not a token type registered
with IANA, the Issuer MUST return an HTTP 422 (Unprocessable Content) error to
the client. The issuer creates a GenericBatchTokenResponse structured as follows:

~~~tls
struct {
  uint16_t token_type;
  select (token_type) {
    case (0x0001): /* Type VOPRF(P-384, SHA-384), RFC 9578 */
      uint8_t evaluated_msg[Ne];
      uint8_t evaluated_proof[Ns + Ns];
    case (0x0002): /* Type Blind RSA (2048-bit), RFC 9578 */
      uint8_t blind_sig[Nk];
  }
} TokenResponse;

struct {
  optional<TokenResponse> token_response; /* Defined by token_type */
} OptionalTokenResponse;

struct {
  OptionalTokenResponse token_responses<V>;
} GenericBatchTokenResponse
~~~

GenericBatchTokenResponse.token_responses is a variable-size vector of
OptionalTokenResponses. OptionalTokenResponse.token_response is an optional
TokenResponse (as specified in {{optional-value}}) , where an absence of
TokenResponse indicates that the Issuer failed or refused to issue the
associated TokenRequest.

The Issuer MUST generate an HTTP response with status code 200 whose content
consists of TokenResponse, with the content type set as
"application/private-token-generic-batch-response". Clients MUST ignore the
response if the status code is not 200 or if the content type is not
"application/private-token-generic-batch-response".

~~~
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/private-token-generic-batch-response
Content-Length: <Length of GenericBatchTokenResponse>

<Bytes containing the GenericBatchTokenResponse>
~~~

If the Issuer issues some but not all tokens, it MUST return an HTTP 206 error
to the client and continue processing subsequent requests.
For instance, an Issuer MAY return an HTTP 206 error if requests for tokens of
the same token type refer to more than one `truncated_token_key_id`.

If the Issuer decides not to issue any tokens, it MUST return an HTTP 400 to the
client.


## Finalization {#generic-finalization}

The Client tries to deserialize the i-th element of
GenericBatchTokenResponse.token_responses using the protocol associated to
GenericBatchTokenRequest.token_type. If the element has a size of 0, the Client MUST
ignore this token, and continue processing the next token. The Client finalizes
each deserialized TokenResponse using the matching TokenRequest according to the
corresponding finalization procedure defined by the token type.

# Security considerations {#security-considerations}

## Amortized Privately Verifiable Token Batch Issuance

Implementors SHOULD be aware of the security considerations described in {{OPRF,
Section 6.2.3}} and implement mitigation mechanisms. Application can mitigate
this issue by limiting the number of clients and limiting the number of token
requests per client per key.

## Generic Token Batch Issuance

Implementors SHOULD be aware of the inherent linear cost of this token type. An
Issuer MAY ignore TokenRequest if the number of tokens per request past a limit.

# IANA considerations

This section contains IANA codepoint allocation requests.
